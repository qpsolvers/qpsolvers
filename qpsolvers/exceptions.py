Exceptions from qpsolvers.

We catch all solver exceptions and re-throw them in a qpsolvers-owned exception
to avoid abstraction leakage. See this `design decision
<https://github.com/getparthenon/parthenon/wiki/Design-Decision:-Throw-Custom-Exceptions>`__
for more details on the rationale behind this choice.
