    Solve a Quadratic Program defined as:

        \\mbox{minimize} &
            \\frac{1}{2} x^T P x + q^T x \\\\

            & lb \\leq x \\leq ub
        \\end{array}\\end{split}

    using `quadprog <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/quadprog/>`_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    P :
        Symmetric quadratic-cost matrix.
    q :
        Quadratic-cost vector.
    G :
        Linear inequality constraint matrix.
    h :
        Linear inequality constraint vector.
    A :
        Linear equality constraint matrix.
    b :
        Linear equality constraint vector.
    lb :
        Lower bound constraint vector.
    ub :
        Upper bound constraint vector.
    initvals :
        Warm-start guess vector (not used).
    verbose :
        Set to `True` to print out extra information.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        Solution to the QP, if found, otherwise ``None``.

    Note
    ----
    The quadprog solver only considers the lower entries of :math:`P`,
    therefore it will use a different cost than the one intended if a
    non-symmetric matrix is provided.

    Notes
    -----
    All other keyword arguments are forwarded to the quadprog solver. For
    instance, you can call ``quadprog_solve_qp(P, q, G, h, factorized=True)``.
    See the solver documentation for details.
