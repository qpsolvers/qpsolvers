"""Solver interface for `SCS <https://www.cvxgrp.org/scs/>`__.

SCS (Splitting Conic Solver) is a numerical optimization package for solving
large-scale convex quadratic cone problems, which is a general class of
problems that includes quadratic programming. If you use SCS in some academic
work, consider citing the corresponding paper [ODonoghue2021]_.
