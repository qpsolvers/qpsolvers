Solver interface for `ProxQP <https://github.com/qpSWIFT/qpSWIFT>`__.

ProxQP is the QP solver from ProxSuite, a collection of open-source solvers
rooted in revisited primal-dual proximal algorithms. If you are using ProxQP in
your work, consider citing the corresponding paper: `PROX-QP: Yet another
Quadratic Programming Solver for Robotics and beyond
<https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03683733/file/Yet_another_QP_solver_for_robotics_and_beyond.pdf/>`__.

    Parameters
    ----------
    P :
        Symmetric quadratic-cost matrix. Together with :math:`A` and :math:`G`,
        it should satisfy :math:`\\mathrm{rank}([P\\ A^T\\ G^T]) = n`, see the
        rank assumptions below.
    q :
        Quadratic-cost vector.
    G :
        Linear inequality constraint matrix. Together with :math:`P` and
        :math:`A`, it should satisfy :math:`\\mathrm{rank}([P\\ A^T\\ G^T]) =
        n`, see the rank assumptions below.
    h :
        Linear inequality constraint vector.
    A :
        Linear equality constraint matrix. It needs to be full row rank, and
        together with :math:`P` and :math:`G` satisfy
        :math:`\\mathrm{rank}([P\\ A^T\\ G^T]) = n`. See the rank assumptions
        below.
    b :
        Linear equality constraint vector.
    lb :
        Lower bound constraint vector.
    ub :
        Upper bound constraint vector.
    initvals :
        Warm-start guess vector.
    verbose :
        Set to `True` to print out extra information.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        Solution to the QP, if found, otherwise ``None``.

    Notes
    -----
    All other keyword arguments are forwarded as options to ProxQP. For
    instance, you can call ``proxqp_solve_qp(P, q, G, h, TODO(scaron): ...)``.
    See the solver documentation for details.
