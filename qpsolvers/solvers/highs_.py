Solver interface for `HiGHS <https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS>`__.

HiGHS is a high performance serial and parallel solver for large scale sparse
linear optimization problems of the form

.. math::

    \\mathrm{minimize } (1/2) x^T Q x + c^T x
    \\quad
    \\mathrm{subject to } L \\leq Ax \\leq U;
    \\quad
    l \\leq x \\leq u

where Q must be positive semi-definite and, if Q is zero, there may be a
requirement that some of the variables take integer values. Thus HiGHS can
solve linear programming (LP) problems, convex quadratic programming (QP)
problems, and mixed integer programming (MIP) problems. It is mainly written in
C++, but also has some C. It has been developed and tested on various Linux,
MacOS and Windows installations using both the GNU (g++) and Intel (icc) C++
compilers. Note that HiGHS requires (at least) version 4.9 of the GNU compiler.
It has no third-party dependencies.

HiGHS has primal and dual revised simplex solvers, originally written by Qi
Huangfu and further developed by Julian Hall. It also has an interior point
solver for LP written by Lukas Schork, an active set solver for QP written by
Michael Feldmeier, and a MIP solver written by Leona Gottwald. Other features
have been added by Julian Hall and Ivet Galabova, who manages the software
engineering of HiGHS and interfaces to C, C#, FORTRAN, Julia and Python.

    Parameters
    ----------
    P :
        Positive semidefinite quadratic-cost matrix.
    q :
        Quadratic-cost vector.
    G :
        Linear inequality constraint matrix.
    h :
        Linear inequality constraint vector.
    A :
        Linear equality constraint matrix.
    b :
        Linear equality constraint vector.
    lb :
        Lower bound constraint vector.
    ub :
        Upper bound constraint vector.
    initvals :
        Warm-start guess vector.
    backend :
        ProxQP backend to use in ``[None, "dense", "sparse"]``. If ``None``
        (default), the backend is selected based on the type of ``P``.
    verbose :
        Set to `True` to print out extra information.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        Solution to the QP, if found, otherwise ``None``.
