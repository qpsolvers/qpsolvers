"""Solver interface for `OSQP <https://osqp.org/>`__.

The OSQP solver implements an Operator-Splitting method for large-scale convex
quadratic programming. It is designed for both dense and sparse problems, and
convexity is the only assumption it makes on problem data (for instance, it
does not make any rank assumption contrary to :ref:`CVXOPT <CVXOPT rank
assumptions>` or :ref:`qpSWIFT <qpSWIFT rank assumptions>`). If you are using
OSQP in some academic work, consider citing the corresponding paper
[Stellato2020]_.

    """Solve a quadratic program using OSQP.

    Parameters
    ----------
    problem :
        Quadratic program to solve.
    initvals :
        Warm-start guess vector.
    verbose :
        Set to `True` to print out extra information.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        Solution returned by the solver.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the problem is clearly non-convex. See `this recommendation
        <https://osqp.org/docs/interfaces/status_values.html#status-values>`_.
        Note that OSQP may find the problem unfeasible if the problem is
        slightly non-convex (in this context, the meaning of "clearly" and
        "slightly" depends on how close the negative eigenvalues of :math:`P`
        are to zero).

    Note
    ----
    OSQP requires a symmetric `P` and won't check for errors otherwise. Check
    out this point if you `get nan values
    <https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/osqp/issues/10>`_ in your solutions.

    Notes
    -----
    Keyword arguments are forwarded to OSQP. For instance, we can call
    ``osqp_solve_qp(P, q, G, h, u, eps_abs=1e-8, eps_rel=0.0)``. OSQP settings
