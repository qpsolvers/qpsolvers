Solver interface for `OSQP <https://osqp.org/>`__.

The OSQP solver implements an Operator-Splitting method for large-scale convex
quadratic programming. It is designed for both dense and sparse problems, and
convexity is the only assumption it makes on problem data (for instance, it
does not make any rank assumption contrary to :ref:`CVXOPT <CVXOPT rank
assumptions>` or :ref:`qpSWIFT <qpSWIFT rank assumptions>`).

    using `OSQP <https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/osqp>`_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    P :
        Symmetric quadratic-cost matrix.
    q :
        Quadratic cost vector.
    G :
        Linear inequality constraint matrix.
    h :
        Linear inequality constraint vector.
    A :
        Linear equality constraint matrix.
    b :
        Linear equality constraint vector.
    lb :
        Lower bound constraint vector.
    ub :
        Upper bound constraint vector.
    initvals :
        Warm-start guess vector.
    verbose :
        Set to `True` to print out extra information.
    eps_abs :
        Absolute convergence tolerance of the solver. Lower values yield more
        precise solutions at the cost of computation time.
    eps_rel :
        Relative convergence tolerance of the solver. Lower values yield more
        precise solutions at the cost of computation time.
    polish :
        Perform `polishing <https://osqp.org/docs/solver/#polishing>`_, an
        additional step where the solver tries to improve the accuracy of the
        solution. Default is ``True``.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        Solution to the QP, if found, otherwise ``None``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the problem is clearly non-convex. See `this recommendation
        <https://osqp.org/docs/interfaces/status_values.html#status-values>`_.
        Note that OSQP may find the problem unfeasible if the problem is
        slightly non-convex (in this context, the meaning of "clearly" and
        "slightly" depends on how close the negative eigenvalues of :math:`P`
        are to zero).

    Note
    ----
    OSQP requires a symmetric `P` and won't check for errors otherwise. Check
    out this point if you `get nan values
    <https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/osqp/issues/10>`_ in your solutions.

    Notes
    -----
    As of OSQP 0.6.1, the default values for both absolute and relative
    tolerances are set to ``1e-3``, which results in low solver times but
    imprecise solutions compared to the other QP solvers. We lower them to
    ``1e-5`` so that OSQP behaves closer to the other solvers in terms of
    numerical accuracy.

    All other keyword arguments are forwarded to the OSQP solver. For instance,
    you can call ``osqp_solve_qp(P, q, G, h, u, alpha=1.42)``. See the `solver
    documentation <https://osqp.org/docs/interfaces/solver_settings.html>`_ for
    details.
