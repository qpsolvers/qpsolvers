"""Solver interface for `ECOS <https://github.com/embotech/ecos>`__.

ECOS is an interior-point solver for convex second-order cone programs (SOCPs).
designed specifically for embedded applications. ECOS is written in low
footprint, single-threaded, library-free ANSI-C and so runs on most embedded
platforms. For small problems, ECOS is faster than most existing SOCP solvers;
it is still competitive for medium-sized problems up to tens of thousands of
variables. If you are using ECOS in some academic work, consider citing the
corresponding paper [Domahidi2013]_.

    """Solve a quadratic program using ECOS.

    Parameters
    ----------
    P :
        Primal quadratic cost matrix.
    q :
        Primal quadratic cost vector.
    G :
        Linear inequality constraint matrix.
    h :
        Linear inequality constraint vector.
    A :
        Linear equality constraint matrix.
    b :
        Linear equality constraint vector.
    initvals :
        Warm-start guess vector (not used).
    verbose :
        Set to `True` to print out extra information.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        Solution to the QP, if found, otherwise ``None``.

    Raises
    ------
    ProblemError :
        If inequality constraints contain infinite values that the solver
        doesn't handle.

    ValueError :
        If the cost matrix is not positive definite.

    Notes
    -----
    All other keyword arguments are forwarded as options to the ECOS solver.
    For instance, you can call ``qpswift_solve_qp(P, q, G, h, abstol=1e-5)``.

    For a quick overview, the solver accepts the following settings:
