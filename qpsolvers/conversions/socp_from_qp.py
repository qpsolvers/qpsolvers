    r"""Convert a quadratic program to a second-order cone program.

    The quadratic program is defined by:

    .. math::

        \begin{split}\begin{array}{ll}
            \underset{x}{\mbox{minimize}} &
                \frac{1}{2} x^T P x + q^T x \\
            \mbox{subject to}
                & G x \leq h
        \end{array}\end{split}

    The equivalent second-order cone program is:

    .. math::

        \begin{split}\begin{array}{ll}
            \underset{x}{\mbox{minimize}} &
                c^T_s y \\
            \mbox{subject to}
                & G_s y \leq_{\cal K} h_s
        \end{array}\end{split}

    This function is adapted from ``ecosqp.m`` in the `ecos-matlab
    <https://github.com/embotech/ecos-matlab/>`_ repository. See the
    documentation in that script for details on this reformulation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    P :
        Primal quadratic cost matrix.
    q :
        Primal quadratic cost vector.
    G :
        Linear inequality constraint matrix.
    h :
        Linear inequality constraint vector.

    Returns
    -------
    c_socp : array
        SOCP cost vector.
    G_socp : array
        SOCP inequality matrix.
    h_socp : array
        SOCP inequality vector.
    dims : dict
        Dimension dictionary used by SOCP solvers, where ``dims["l"]`` is the
        number of inequality constraints.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError :
        If the cost matrix is not positive definite.
