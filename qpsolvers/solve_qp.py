    using the QP solver selected by the ``solver`` keyword argument.

    Parameters
    ----------
    P :
        Symmetric cost matrix (most solvers require it to be definite as well).
    q :
        Cost vector.
    G :
        Linear inequality matrix.
    h :
        Linear inequality vector.
    A :
        Linear equality matrix.
    b :
        Linear equality vector.
    lb :
        Lower bound constraint vector.
    ub :
        Upper bound constraint vector.
    solver :
        Name of the QP solver, to choose in
        :data:`qpsolvers.available_solvers`. This argument is mandatory.
    initvals :
        Primal candidate vector :math:`x` values used to warm-start the solver.
    sym_proj :
        Set to ``True`` to project the cost matrix :math:`P` to its symmetric
        part. Some solvers assume :math:`P` is symmetric and will return
        unintended results if it is not the case.
    verbose :
        Set to ``True`` to print out extra information.

    Note
    ----
    In quadratic programming, the matrix :math:`P` should be symmetric. Many
    solvers (including CVXOPT, OSQP and quadprog) leverage this property and
    may return unintended results when it is not the case. You can set
    ``sym_proj=True`` to project :math:`P` on its symmetric part, at the cost
    of a little computation time.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        Optimal solution if found, otherwise ``None``.

    Raises
    ------
    NoSolverSelected
        If the ``solver`` keyword argument is not set.

    SolverNotFound
        If the requested solver is not in :data:`qpsolvers.available_solvers`.

    ValueError
        If the problem is not correctly defined. For instance, if the solver
        requires a definite cost matrix but the provided matrix :math:`P` is
        not.

    Notes
    -----
    Extra keyword arguments given to this function are forwarded to the
    underlying solver. For example, we can call OSQP with a custom absolute
    feasibility tolerance by ``solve_qp(P, q, G, h, solver='osqp',
    eps_abs=1e-6)``. See the :ref:`Supported solvers <Supported solvers>` page
    for details on the parameters available to each solver.

    There is no guarantee that a ``ValueError`` is raised if the provided
    problem is non-convex, as some solvers don't check for this. Rather, if the
    problem is non-convex and the solver fails because of that, then a
    ``ValueError`` will be raised.
