        \\end{array}\\end{split}

    using the QP solver selected by the ``solver`` keyword argument.

    Parameters
    ----------
    P :
        Symmetric quadratic-cost matrix (most solvers require it to be definite
        as well).
    q :
        Quadratic-cost vector.
    G :
        Linear inequality matrix.
    h :
        Linear inequality vector.
    A :
        Linear equality matrix.
    b :
        Linear equality vector.
    lb :
        Lower bound constraint vector.
    ub :
        Upper bound constraint vector.
    solver :
        Name of the QP solver, to choose in
        :data:`qpsolvers.available_solvers`. This argument is mandatory.
    initvals :
        Vector of initial :math:`x` values used to warm-start the solver.
    sym_proj :
        Set to ``True`` when the :math:`P` matrix provided is not symmetric.
    verbose :
        Set to ``True`` to print out extra information.

    Note
    ----
    In quadratic programming, the matrix :math:`P` should be symmetric. Many
    solvers (including CVXOPT, OSQP and quadprog) leverage this property and
    may return unintended results when it is not the case. You can set
    ``sym_proj=True`` to project :math:`P` on its symmetric part, at the cost
    of some computation time.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        Optimal solution if found, otherwise ``None``.

    Raises
    ------
    NoSolverSelected
        If the ``solver`` keyword argument is not set.

    SolverNotFound
        If the requested solver is not in :data:`qpsolvers.available_solvers`.

    ValueError
        If the problem is not correctly defined. For instance, if the solver
        requires a definite matrix :math:`P` but the one provided is not.

    Note
    ----
    We don't guarantee that a ``ValueError`` is raised if the provided problem
    is non-convex, as some solvers don't check for this. Rather, if the problem
    is non-convex and the solver fails because of that, then a ``ValueError``
    will be raised.

    Notes
    -----
    Extra keyword arguments given to this function are forwarded to the
    underlying solver. For example, OSQP has a setting `eps_abs` which we can
    provide by ``solve_qp(P, q, G, h, solver='osqp', eps_abs=1e-4)``.

    Solve the "safer" Quadratic Program with repulsive inequality constraints,

        \\begin{split}\\begin{array}{ll}

    Slack variables `s` (i.e. distance to inequality constraints) are added to
    the vector of optimization variables and included in the cost function.
    This pushes the solution of this "safer" QP is further inside the
    linear constraint region.

    Parameters
    ----------
    P :
        Symmetric quadratic-cost matrix.
    q :
        Quadratic-cost vector.
    G :
        Linear inequality matrix.
    h :
        Linear inequality vector.
    sr :
        This is the "slack repulsion" parameter that makes inequality
        constraints repulsive. In practice it weighs the linear term on slack
        variables in the augmented cost function. Higher values bring the
        solution further inside the constraint region but override the
        minimization of the original objective.
    reg :
        Regularization term that weighs squared slack variables in the cost
        function. Increase this parameter in case of numerical instability, and
        otherwise set it as small as possible compared, so that the squared
        slack cost is as small as possible compared to the regular cost.
    solver :
        Name of the QP solver to use.
    initvals :
        Vector of initial `x` values used to warm-start the solver.
    sym_proj :
        Set to `True` when the `P` matrix provided is not symmetric.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        Optimal solution to the relaxed QP, if found, otherwise ``None``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the quadratic program is not feasible.

    Note
    ----
    This is a legacy function.

    This method can be found in the Inverse Kinematics resolution of Nozawa et
    al. (Humanoids 2016). It also appears in earlier works such as the
    "optimally safe" tension distribution algorithm of Borgstrom et al. (IEEE
    Transactions on Robotics, 2009).
