class Solution:
    """Solution returned by a QP solver for a given problem.

    Attributes
    ----------
    extras :
        Other outputs, specific to each solver.

    found :
        True if the solution was found successfully by a solver, False if the
        solver did not find a solution or detected an unfeasible problem,
        ``None`` if no solver was run.

    problem :
        Quadratic program the solution corresponds to.

    obj :
        Value of the primal objective at the solution (``None`` if no solution
        was found).

    x :
        Solution vector for the primal quadratic program (``None`` if no
        solution was found).

    y :
        Dual multipliers for equality constraints (``None`` if no solution was
        found, or if there is no equality constraint). The dimension of
        :math:`y` is equal to the number of equality constraints. The values
        :math:`y_i` can be either positive or negative.

    z :
        Dual multipliers for linear inequality constraints (``None`` if no
        solution was found, or if there is no inequality constraint). The
        dimension of :math:`z` is equal to the number of inequalities. The
        value :math:`z_i` for inequality :math:`i` is always positive.

        - If :math:`z_i > 0`, the inequality is active at the solution:
          :math:`G_i x = h_i`.
        - If :math:`z_i = 0`, the inequality is inactive at the solution:
          :math:`G_i x < h_i`.

    z_box :
        Dual multipliers for box inequality constraints (``None`` if no
        solution was found, or if there is no box inequality). The sign of
        :math:`z_{box,i}` depends on the active bound:

        - If :math:`z_{box,i} < 0`, then the lower bound :math:`lb_i = x_i` is
          active at the solution.
        - If :math:`z_{box,i} = 0`, then neither the lower nor the upper bound
          are active and :math:`lb_i < x_i < ub_i`.
        - If :math:`z_{box,i} > 0`, then the upper bound :math:`x_i = ub_i` is
          active at the solution.
