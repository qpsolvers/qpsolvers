class Solution:

    """
    Solution provided by a QP solver to a given problem.

    Attributes
    ----------
    problem :
        Quadratic program the solution corresponds to.

    obj :
        Value of the primal objective at the solution (``None`` if no solution
        was found).

    x :
        Solution vector of the primal quadratic program (``None`` if no
        solution was found).

    y :
        Dual multipliers for equality constraints (``None`` if no solution was
        found). The dimension of :math:`y` is equal to the number of equality
        constraints. The values :math:`y_i` can be either positive or negative.

    z :
        Dual multipliers for linear inequality constraints (``None`` if no
        solution was found). The dimension of :math:`z` is equal to the number
        of inequalities. The value :math:`z_i` for inequality :math:`i` is
        always positive.

        - If :math:`z_i > 0`, the inequality is active at the solution:
          :math:`G_i x = h_i`.
        - If :math:`z_i = 0`, the inequality is inactive at the solution:
          :math:`G_i x < h_i`.

    z_box :
        Dual multipliers for box inequality constraints (``None`` if no
        solution was found). The sign of :math:`z_{box,i}` depends on the
        active bound:

        - If :math:`z_{box,i} < 0`, then the lower bound :math:`lb_i = x_i` is
          active at the solution.
        - If :math:`z_{box,i} = 0`, then neither the lower nor the upper bound
          are active and :math:`lb_i < x_i < ub_i`.
        - If :math:`z_{box,i} > 0`, then the upper bound :math:`x_i = ub_i` is
          active at the solution.

    extras :
        Other outputs, specific to each solver.
