    using the QP solver selected by the ``solver`` keyword argument.

    Parameters
    ----------
    R :
        Union[np.ndarray, spa.csc_matrix] factor of the cost function (most
        solvers require :math:`R^T W R` to be positive definite, which means
        :math:`R` should have full row rank).
    s :
        Vector term of the cost function.
    G :
        Linear inequality matrix.
    h :
        Linear inequality vector.
    A :
        Linear equality matrix.
    b :
        Linear equality vector.
    lb :
        Lower bound constraint vector.
    ub :
        Upper bound constraint vector.
    W :
        Definite symmetric weight matrix used to define the norm of the cost
        function. The standard L2 norm (W = Identity) is used by default.
    solver :
        Name of the QP solver, to choose in
        :data:`qpsolvers.available_solvers`. This argument is mandatory.
    initvals :
        Vector of initial `x` values used to warm-start the solver.
    sym_proj :
        Set to `True` when the `R` matrix provided is not symmetric.
    verbose :
        Set to `True` to print out extra information.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        Optimal solution if found, otherwise ``None``.

    Notes
    -----
    Extra keyword arguments given to this function are forwarded to the
    underlying solvers. For example, OSQP has a setting `eps_abs` which we can
    provide by ``solve_ls(R, s, G, h, solver='osqp', eps_abs=1e-4)``.
