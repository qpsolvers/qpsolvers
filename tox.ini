[MESSAGES CONTROL]
; C0103: Argument name doesn't conform to snake_case naming style (qpsolvers uses uppercase for matrices)
; E0611: No name 'solve_qp' in module 'quadprog' (false positive, we have mypy to cover such errors)
; E1130: bad operand type for unary - (false positives fixed in newer versions of pylint, see https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/2436, anyhow we have mypy to cover such errors)
; R0801: Similar lines in * files (all our functions have the same prototype)
; R0913: Too many arguments (our functions has more than 5 arguments)
; R0914: Too many local variables (our functions usually have more than 15 local variables)
