This library provides a one-stop shop [`solve_qp`](https://qpsolvers.github.io/qpsolvers/quadratic-programming.html#qpsolvers.solve_qp) function to solve convex quadratic programs:

$$
\begin{split}
\begin{array}{ll}
\underset{x}{\mbox{minimize}}
    & \frac{1}{2} x^T P x + q^T x \\
\mbox{subject to}
    & G x \leq h \\
    & A x = b \\
    & lb \leq x \leq ub
\end{array}
\end{split}
$$

Vector inequalities apply coordinate by coordinate. The function returns the primal solution $x^\*$ found by the backend QP solver, or ``None`` in case of failure/unfeasible problem. All solvers require the problem to be convex, meaning the matrix $P$ should be [positive semi-definite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definite_symmetric_matrix). Some solvers further require the problem to be strictly convex, meaning $P$ should be positive definite.

**Dual multipliers:** there is also a [`solve_problem`](https://qpsolvers.github.io/qpsolvers/quadratic-programming.html#qpsolvers.solve_problem) function that returns not only the primal solution, but also its dual multipliers and all other relevant quantities computed by the backend solver.

## Example

To solve a quadratic program, build the matrices that define it and call ``solve_qp``, selecting the backend QP solver via the ``solver`` keyword argument:

```python
import numpy as np
from qpsolvers import solve_qp

M = np.array([[1.0, 2.0, 0.0], [-8.0, 3.0, 2.0], [0.0, 1.0, 1.0]])
P = M.T @ M  # this is a positive definite matrix
q = np.array([3.0, 2.0, 3.0]) @ M
G = np.array([[1.0, 2.0, 1.0], [2.0, 0.0, 1.0], [-1.0, 2.0, -1.0]])
h = np.array([3.0, 2.0, -2.0])
A = np.array([1.0, 1.0, 1.0])
b = np.array([1.0])

x = solve_qp(P, q, G, h, A, b, solver="proxqp")
print(f"QP solution: {x = }")
```

This example outputs the solution ``[0.30769231, -0.69230769,  1.38461538]``. It is also possible to get dual multipliers at the solution, as shown in [this example](https://qpsolvers.github.io/qpsolvers/quadratic-programming.html#dual-multipliers).

## Installation

### PyPI

To install the library with open source QP solvers:

```console
pip install qpsolvers[open_source_solvers]
```

To install a subset of QP solvers:

```console
pip install qpsolvers[clarabel,daqp,proxqp,scs]
```

To install only the library itself:

```console
pip install qpsolvers
```

When imported, qpsolvers loads all the solvers it can find and lists them in ``qpsolvers.available_solvers``.

### Conda

## Benchmark

The results below come from [`qpbenchmark`](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpbenchmark), a benchmark for QP solvers in Python. In the following tables, solvers are called with their default settings and compared over whole test sets by [shifted geometric mean](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpbenchmark#shifted-geometric-mean) ("shm" for short). Lower is better and 1.0 corresponds to the best solver.
